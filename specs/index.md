# Bunker specifications

Bunker is a very efficient binary data format that can be used as a replacement for Json, Csv or MessagePack. Bunker format is great for every type of data but especially shines when handling big arrays of objects.

In average, Bunker data is 130% smaller than JSON and 100% smaller than MessagePack. If you use big arrays of objects, it can easly go up to 400% smaller than JSON. Bunker is the perfect alternative between space efficiency (zipped data will always be better) and encoding / decoding speed (zipped data will always be very very much slower).

Furthermore, Bunker can also store and load - unlike Json and MessagePack :

- Big integers
- Regular expressions
- Dates
- Circular references (JSON will crash)
- Arrays with properties
- Maps
- Sets
- Maps and sets with properties

This document explains the format used by Bunker to achieve great performance in storing data.

## Notions

The following notions are necessary to understand the bunker specifications.

### Base enumerations

The specification is based on two enumerations:

- The `Type` enumeration is used to write and read the schema/
  ```ts
  enum Type {
    unknown = 0x00,
    null = 0x01,
    any = 0x02,
    boolean = 0x03,
    character = 0x04,
    integer = 0x05,
    positiveInteger = 0x06,
    bigInteger = 0x07,
    number = 0x08,
    string = 0x09,
    stringReference = 0x0A,
    regExp = 0x0B,
    date = 0x0C,
    nullable = 0x0D,
    reference = 0x0E,
    object = 0x0F,
    tuple = 0x10,
    record = 0x11,
    array = 0x12,
    set = 0x13,
    map = 0x14,
  }
  ```
- The `ByteIndicator` enumeration is used to handle special use cases.
  ```ts
  enum ByteIndicator {
    null = 0x00,
    undefined = 0x01,
    defined = 0x02,
    object = 0x03,
    reference = 0xF8,
    stop = 0xFF,
  }
  ```

### Integers

Bunker use a special format for integer which is named *elastic integers*. In low-level languages like C, the size of an integer is static: every `short int` is 2-bytes long, `long int` 4-bytes long, and `long long int` 8-bytes long.

Integers in Bunker use *as few space as possible* and can be infinitely big, using a very simple rule:

- if the first bit of the current byte is `1`, then the next byte continue to describe the number,
- if the first bit of the current byte is `0`, then this is the last byte.

These two rules have a single exception:

- in case of signed integer, the first bit of the first byte is used to set the sign, and then the second bit of the first byte is used to indicate the continuation of the integer.

Examples of `positive integers`:

`0` -> `00000000`
`1` -> `00000001`
...
`127` -> `01111111`
`128` -> `10000001 00000000`
`129` -> `10000001 00000001`

Examples of `signed integers`:

`-1` -> `10000001`
`-0` -> `10000000`
`1` -> `00000001`
...
`63` -> `00111111`
`64` -> `01000001 00000000`
`-64` -> `11000001 00000000`
`-65` -> `11000001 00000001`

### Floating numbers

Any number `n` can be written in the form: `n = b * 10 ^ i`, where `b` and `i` are signed integers, and `b` being as small as possible.

In Bunker, a floating number is simply `i` and then `b`, written as *signed elastic integers*.

Examples:

`0` -> `0e0` -> `00000000 00000000`
`-0` -> `-0e0` -> `00000000 10000000`
`1` -> `1e0` ->`00000000 00000001`
`9` -> `9e0` ->`00000000 00001001`
`10` -> `1e1` ->`00000001 00000001`
`11` -> `11e0` ->`00000000 00001011`
`0.1` -> `1e-1` ->`10000001 00000001`
`-0.1` -> `-1e-1` ->`10000001 10000001`

### Strings

Bunker strings:

- are encoded in UTF-8,
- finish with a trailing zero.

Examples:

`"a"` -> `[97, 0]`
`"Ã "` -> `[195, 160, 0]`
`"çš„"` -> `[231, 154, 132, 0]`
`"ðŸ˜‹"` -> `[240, 159, 152, 139, 0]`

### Schema

Bunker data is composed of two parts: the data schema and then the data itself. Storing the schema before writing the data is the key to Bunker's efficieny. Imagine you have this object in Json:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "name1",
    "company": "company1",
    "phone": "number1"
  },
  {
    "name": "name2",
    "company": "company2",
    "phone": "number2"
  },
  {
    "name": "name3",
    "company": "company3",
    "phone": "number3"
  },
  ...etc etc...
]
```

Then if we would write this same data using Bunker in a Json-way, it would be something like:

```json
{
  "schema": {
    "type": "Array",
    "arrayOf": {
      "name": "String",
      "company": "String",
      "phone": "String",
    }
  },
  "data": [
    ["name1", "company1", "number1"],
    ["name2", "company2", "number2"],
    ["name3", "company3", "number3"],
    ...etc etc...
  ]
}
```

We can easily understand why the longer and the longer the array becomes, the better will be Bunker when compared to Json. The keys "name", "company" and "phone" will not be repeated with Bunker, which will lead to a huge difference in space.

It's the same way as Csv or Sql works - except Csv can only handle arrays of objects, while Bunker can handle any type of data. 

### References

References is one of the key features of Bunker. It enables you to use circular references and it helps to reduce the encoded size.

There are three types of references:

- object references in schema,
- object references in data,
- string references in data.

Usually when you need to deal with references, you would create a dictionary which contains all your referenced objects / strings, and when you need to access the object you point to it with its index.

This approach would force you to use a dictionary on one hand, the data on the other, and finally merge the two. This is sub-optimal because it would cause need to copy-paste all the data in memory when the encoding is done.

The Bunker way is to not use a separate dictionary. Every encountered object is stored in an array and the position in the array is its index. Concretely:

- when you encode data, it means every time you encounter an object, you push it to your refererences' array, and in case you encounter the object again, you write its index as reference instead of writing again the object;
- and when you decode data, every time you encounter an object you push it to your references array, and when you encounter a reference, you retrieve the right object from this array.

Three arrays are needed: one for object references in schema, one for object references in encoded data, and one for string references in encoded data. The indexes don't mix between those three arrays.

## Specifications

### Schema specifications

- `Primitive`
  
  The type of the primitive is written as a byte.
  Example: for a boolean, write `Type.boolean` - which is equal to `3`.
  
  Size (in bytes): `1`


- `Object`

  `Type.object` is written as a byte, then all the keys following by their value's schema, then a finishing `ByteIndicator.stop`.

  Examples:

  ```ts
  data: {}
  schema: [Type.object, ByteIndicator.stop]
  ```

  ```ts
  data: { foo: "bar", x: 12 }
  schema: [Type.object, "foo", Type.string, "x", Type.number, ByteIndicator.stop]
  ```


  Size: `1 + sizeof(keys) + sizeof(T)`

- `Reference<T>`

  A reference to a previously used schema object.

  `Type.reference` is written as a byte, then its index as an `positive integer`.

  Examples:

  ```ts
  data: { self: data }
  schema: [Type.object, "self", Type.reference, 0, ByteIndicator.stop]
  // we reference to 0 because the first encountered object is `data`
  // if `data` was nested inside another object, its index would not be 0
  ```

  ```ts
  data: { meta: { foo: "bar" }, referenceToMeta: data.meta }
  schema: [Type.object, "meta", Type.object, "foo", Type.string, ByteIndicator.stop, "referenceToMeta", Type.reference, 1, ByteIndicator.stop]
  // we reference to 1 because data.meta is the second encountered object
  ```

- `Nullable<T>`
  
  A nullable is value is a value that can be null or undefined.

  `Type.nullable` is written as a byte, then T's schema is written.

  Size: `1 + sizeof(T)`

  Examples:

  ```ts
  // nullable integer
  [Type.nullable, Type.integer]
  // nullable object with a 'foo' key with a string value
  [Type.nullable, Type.object, "foo", Type.string, ByteIndicator.stop]
  ```

- `Array<T, properties: O>`

  `Type.array` is written as a byte, then T's schema is written, then O's schema.

  Examples:

  ```ts
  data: [1, 2, 3]
  schema: [Type.array, Type.number, ByteIndicator.stop]  // the `ByteIndicator.stop` is indicating the array has no properties
  ```

  ```ts
  data: [1, 2, 3, length: 3, capacity: 12]  // this is an array with properties
  schema: [Type.array, Type.number, "length", Type.number, "capacity", Type.number, ByteIndicator.stop]
  ```

  Size: `1 + sizeof(T) + sizeof(O)`

- `Set<T, properties: O>`

  `Type.set` is written as a byte, then T's schema is written, then O's schema.

  Size: `1 + sizeof(T) + sizeof(O)`

- `Map<T, properties: O>`

  All map keys must be strings.

  `Type.map` is written as a byte, then T's schema is written, then O's schema.

  Size: `1 + sizeof(T) + sizeof(O)`

- `Record<T>`

  A `record` is similar to a map: it's a dictionary with strings a key and with T as the type of the values.

  The difference between a record and a map depends on the language. In Javascript the record is an object while a map is a Map. In C++, both are the same - except a record cannot have properties.

  `Type.record` is written as a byte, then T's schema is written.

  Size: `1 + sizeof(T)`

- `Tuple<T1, T2, T3, ...>`

  `Type.tuple` is written as a byte, then the tuple length is written as a `positive integer`, then T1's schema is written, then T2's, etc...

  Size: `1 + sizeof(length) + sizeof(T1) + sizeof(T2) + ...`
