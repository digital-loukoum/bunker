○ Sets and maps can have other properties
○ Add string references (could greatly improve speed and size for many cases)
○ Add tuples
○ Benchmark : add fastest and percentage

✔ Benchmark : compare bunker with and without schema => performance boost with schema is impressive @done(21-01-28 16:36)
✔ Benchmark : compare file writing speed => fastest is monosized-buffer @done(21-01-28 16:35)
✔ Add references @done(21-01-28 15:45)
✔ Rewrite schema's API : no more Maps and Sets @done(21-01-27 11:26)

✘ Streamed file reading => not necessary @cancelled(21-01-27 11:27)

Next:
	- Use an async service worker
	- Improve referencing performances
